# SurfsUp Project

## Overview: 

The purpose of this project is to analyze data from W. Avy on a weather dataset that he has from the island of Oahu. The weather conditions data will then be stored in an SQLite database. The goal is to use this data to determine if the weather in the area will be a suitable location to open a Surf n’ Shake shop. If Oahu does well, then other location could be a viable location for another business location. 

## Results: Three Key Differences

1. The average temperature for both months are only off by four degrees. June’s average temperature is 75 degrees and December’s average temperature is 71 degrees. 
2. The minimum and maximum temperature also do not fluctuate by a significant amount. While the minimum for June and December has an eight-degree difference, the maximum only fluctuates by two degrees. 
3. Between the two months the temperatures stay within the same range and do not vary significantly.

September 
## Summary:  
This analysis shows that the temperature in Oahu does not fluctuate significantly throughout the year and the chance of continuous rainfall is low. To dig more into the data, two additional queries were run, one for the month of March and the second for the month of September. Both months show similar information with a six-degree variation in average temperature, eight-degree variation in minimum temperature, and a five-degree variation in maximum temperature. Oahu would be a good location to open a Surf N’ Shake becaus4 of the low variation within temperature and with little precipitation throughout the year.
